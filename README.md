To run the page you need to Open up a terminal and run the command node server.js, then copy the http adress into a google search bar and you can then access the webpage or if you click on the link in the terminal it will bring you to the web page.
I completed part 3 by creating an index.html fil that has a button that displays the content that is in the JSON files that is found in the country-objects folder. I also completed a button that displays the first 20 countrys in the list.
I completed part 4 by adding 6 different funcitonalities to the page. 
1: I added an animation to the top paragrapgh and have it fade in on load
2: I added a button called click me that once clicked slides in  with a paragraph describing the technologies used in the web page.
3: I added a pulsing animaiton to the header of the page.
4: I added a button that allows the user to change the backgrond from white to yellow and back to white.
5: I added a button that jumps to the footer of the page for when the list is to large and user wishes to go to the ed of the table.
6: I added a button that jumps to the header from the footer if the user has scroled to the end of the table.

I was unable to complete part 5, use a JQUERY for s"elect a specific cell of
the table and change its colour once it is selected like in here"
